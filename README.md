# COMP9321_Data_Mashup
Repository for group working in assignment 3

## The dataset will be used in the mashup
Fisheries and aquaculture production,New South Wales/Victoria/Queensland/South Australia/ Western Australia/Tasmania/Northern Territory
* Seafood exports in 2015-2016,by state,Australia
* Seafood exports in 2014-2015,by state,Australia
* Seafood exports in 2013-2014,by state,Australia

## Introduction for this task
Based on the Fisheries and aquaculture production in different states, we calculate the average unit price for the different kinds of species and the yield of the species.

Through the seafood exports data from 2013-2016, by state, we can get the average exports from different state.  We will using the yield of the species minus the average exports from different state and then we can collect the rough data for the consumption of species in the different states. We will sort the consumption of species and then we want to get which kinds of species are popular in the states. We will select five species to display. This can help wholesalers choose which kinds of seafood should they purchase.

## The possible Data display
User can input the specie name and the number of what they want. The data will be shown if the unit price is cheaper and then depend on the yield by the word cloud.
The user input the speciesâ€™ name and it will show bar charts which help users to know which state will consume more and the bar charts are divided by different species.
